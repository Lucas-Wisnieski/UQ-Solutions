Hi Claude,

Write a growth outlook summary for an academic program. Data is for academic leaders (provosts, deans, chairs).

CURRENT ANALYSIS DATA:
- Program: {{PROGRAM}}
- Job Target: {{JOB_TARGET}}
- Data Source: {{DATA_SOURCE}}
- Analysis Time: {{EXTRACTION_TIME}}
- Metrics: {{METRICS_COUNT}}

KEY METRICS:
{{METRICS}}

REQUIRED FORMAT:
**Program name, award level**
*Single-line market outlook summary*

**Why we like it**
• Positive attribute 1
• Positive attribute 2  
• Positive attribute 3

**Potential concerns**
• Negative attribute 1
• Negative attribute 2
• Negative attribute 3

**Overall assessment**
• 3-4 sentence summary

STYLE: Keep sentences short (E.B. White style). Round earnings to nearest $1K (e.g., $96K), percentages to whole numbers (12%), SUG to one decimal (1.8). Avoid vague terms like "strong positioning."

ANALYSIS CRITERIA (5 key factors):

**MARKET GROWTH** (Score max: 2)
- SUG >2=exceptional, 1-2=strong, 0.2-1=moderate, 0-0.2=barely growing, <0=decline
- % Growing >80%=exceptional, 70-80%=strong, 60-70%=good, 50-60%=decent, <50%=concern
- Positive example: "Strong **market growth**, SUG=1.4 and 68% of programs growing"
- Negative example: "Concerning **market decline**, SUG=-0.4 and only 38% growing"

**SCHOOLS LIKE US** (Score max: 3)  
- SUG Segment: >3=exceptional, 2-3=strong, 1-2=good, 0.2-1=moderate, <0.2=concern
- % Institutions Offering: >80%=universal, 50-70%=widely offered, 20-30%=not unusual, <5%=rarely offered
- % Growing Segment Market most important variable
- Positive example: "Exceptional performance among **schools like us**. Broadly offered (72%), with 88% growing. Strong SUG=3.2"
- Negative example: "Poor performance among **schools like us**. Only 32% growing, declining SUG=-1.2"

**OPPORTUNITY SIZE** (Score max: 2)
- Expected Completions: >25=exceptional, 20-25=large, 15-20=significant, 10-15=decent, 5-10=small, <5=very small
- Express as range: lower-higher (e.g., 8-12)
- Positive example: "Large **opportunity**, 21-23 completions expected per year"
- Negative example: "Small **program size**, only 3-4 completions expected per year"

**WORKFORCE DEMAND** (Score max: 2)
- Jobs SUG: >2=exceptional, 1-2=strong, 0.5-1=growth, 0.2-0.5=moderate, <0=decline  
- Demand:Supply Ratio: >200%=exceptional unmet demand, 150-200%=significant, 100-150%=unmet need, 80-100%=possible saturation, <80%=likely saturation
- Job Postings Index: >2=exceptional, 1.5-2=very strong, 1.25-1.5=strong, 1-1.25=decent, 0.75-1=some, <0.5=weak
- Mention UQ job and state
- Positive example: "Excellent **workforce demand** for accountants in [state], Jobs SUG=1.6, Job Postings=1.1, Demand:Supply=176%"
- Negative example: "Weak **workforce demand**, Jobs SUG=-0.8, Job Postings=0.4, Demand:Supply=72%"

**EARNINGS OUTCOMES** (Score max: 1)
- Median Salary: >$110K=exceptional, $100-110K=excellent, $90-100K=very strong, $80-90K=strong, $70-80K=good, $60-70K=moderate, $50-60K=modest/poor(grad), $40-50K=poor, <$40K=very poor
- First-year earnings (undergrad): >$80K=exceptional, $70-80K=excellent, $60-70K=very strong, $50-60K=strong, $40-50K=moderate, $30-40K=poor, <$30K=very poor
- First-year earnings (grad): >$100K=exceptional, $90-100K=excellent, $80-90K=very strong, $70-80K=strong, $60-70K=decent, $50-60K=poor, <$40K=extremely poor
- Positive example: "Strong **earnings outcomes**, median salary $86K, first-year earnings $64K"
- Negative example: "Poor **earnings outcomes**, median $48K, first-year $42K. Poor ROI may reduce tuition revenue"

BULLET RULES:
- Under "Why we like it": Include ONLY positive factors (skip negatives)
- Under "Potential concerns": Include ONLY negative factors (skip positives)  
- Match evaluative language to actual scores
- Skip bullets if factor isn't positive/negative respectively

OVERALL ASSESSMENT ADDITIONS:
- Health sciences (PT/OT/PA) with strong metrics: "Although investment is significant, potential for game-changing growth may make it rewarding"
- Graduate programs with poor earnings: "Poor earnings require careful financial viability planning"  
- Small undergraduate programs: "Small size suggests partnering with Rize/Acadeum for cost-effectiveness"
